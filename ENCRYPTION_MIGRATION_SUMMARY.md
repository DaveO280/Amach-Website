## 🔑 Key Technical Details

### Encryption Key Derivation

**Algorithm**: PBKDF2 (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2)

```typescript
const key = PBKDF2({
  password: walletSignature,      // From user's wallet
  salt: walletAddress,             // Unique per wallet
  iterations: 100,000,             // High security
  keySize: 256 bits,               // AES-256
  hasher: SHA-256                  // Cryptographic hash
});
```

### Message Signed by User

```
Amach Health - Derive Encryption Key

This signature is used to encrypt your health data.

Nonce: 0x<wallet_address>
```

**Properties**:

- ✅ Deterministic (same wallet = same key)
- ✅ Unique per wallet
- ✅ No gas cost (signature only)
- ✅ Cannot be used for transactions

### Session Key Cache

```typescript
{
  cache: Map<address, {key, expiresAt}>,
  CACHE_DURATION: 30 * 60 * 1000, // 30 minutes
  storage: "In-memory only (never persisted)"
}
```

**Benefits**:

- ✅ Reduces signature requests
- ✅ Better UX (one signature per session)
- ✅ Auto-expires for security
- ✅ Cleared on disconnect
- ✅ Never touches localStorage

## 🛡️ Security Improvements

| Aspect                | Before                        | After                          |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Key Storage**       | localStorage (vulnerable)     | In-memory cache (secure)       |
| **Key Generation**    | Random (unpredictable)        | Wallet-derived (deterministic) |
| **Key Persistence**   | Permanent                     | 30-minute expiry               |
| **Cross-Device**      | ❌ Different keys             | ✅ Same wallet = same key      |
| **XSS Risk**          | ⚠️ High (key in localStorage) | ✅ Low (memory-only)           |
| **Key Recovery**      | ❌ Impossible if lost         | ✅ Always re-derivable         |
| **Wallet Binding**    | ❌ No connection              | ✅ Cryptographically bound     |
| **Session Isolation** | ❌ Shared key                 | ✅ Per-session caching         |

## 🚀 User Experience Impact

### First-Time User

1. Connects wallet ✅
2. Creates health profile ✅
3. **Signs message** ✅ (new step)
4. Data encrypted and stored ✅
5. Key cached for 30 minutes ✅

**Impact**: One additional signature request per session

### Returning User (Same Session)

1. Already connected ✅
2. Key in cache (<30 min) ✅
3. **No signature needed** ✅
4. Instant access to data ✅

**Impact**: No change - cached key used

### Returning User (New Session)

1. Connects wallet ✅
2. Key cache empty ✅
3. **Signs message** ✅ (one-time)
4. Data decrypted ✅
5. Key cached for 30 minutes ✅

**Impact**: One signature request per new session

## 🔄 Migration Process

### Automatic Migration

```typescript
// Auto-runs on app initialization
import { autoMigrateIfNeeded } from "@/utils/migrateToWalletEncryption";

autoMigrateIfNeeded();
```

**What it does**:

1. Detects old encryption keys in localStorage
2. Removes all `health_encryption_key_{address}` entries
3. Preserves `health_profile_{address}` entries
4. Logs migration results

**User Impact**: Seamless - no action required

### Manual Migration (Optional)

```typescript
import { migrateToWalletDerivedEncryption } from "@/utils/migrateToWalletEncryption";

const result = migrateToWalletDerivedEncryption();
console.log(result.message);
// "Migration complete! Removed 3 old encryption keys."
```

- ✅ No linting errors
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ Security documentation created
- ✅ Migration utility tested

### During Deployment

- [ ] Deploy new code

- [ ] Monitor for signature request errors
- [ ] Check localStorage for old keys (should be removed)

### Post-Deployment

- [ ] Verify users can sign messages
- [ ] Test encryption/decryption flow
- [ ] Monitor error rates
- [ ] Confirm old localStorage keys removed
- [ ] Test cross-device key derivation

## 🐛 Known Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Decryption failed" Error

**Cause**: User encrypted data with old localStorage key  
**Solution**: User must re-enter health profile data (one-time)  
**Prevention**: Migration preserves profile data for re-encryption

### Issue: "Signature required every time"

**Cause**: Cache expired or user rejecting signature  
**Solution**: Normal behavior after 30 min or on rejection  
**Prevention**: None - this is by design for security

### Issue: "Can't access old data"

**Cause**: Data encrypted with old random key (now removed)  
**Solution**: User must re-enter health profile (one-time)  
**Prevention**: Future data always uses wallet-derived key
