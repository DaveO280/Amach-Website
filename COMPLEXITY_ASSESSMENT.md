# Amach Health - User Experience Complexity Assessment

## Executive Summary

This document assesses potential confusion points for new users on the Amach Health platform and provides recommendations for improving the onboarding experience.

---

## Critical Confusion Points

### 1. **Technical Jargon Overload** 🔴 HIGH PRIORITY

#### Issues Identified:

- **"ZKsync SSO Wallet"** - Users don't know what ZKsync or SSO means
- **"IPFS"** - Technical term used without explanation
- **"Sessions"** - "Create Session" and "End Session" buttons with no context
- **"On-Chain Profile"** - Blockchain terminology assumes prior knowledge
- **"Encrypted storage"** - Technical security detail that may overwhelm

#### User Impact:

- 🤔 "What is ZKsync and why do I need it?"
- 🤔 "What's the difference between connecting wallet and creating a session?"
- 🤔 "Why is there a badge saying 'Profile On-Chain'?"

#### Recommendations:

```typescript
// BEFORE: Technical
"Connect ZKsync SSO Wallet";

// AFTER: User-friendly
"Connect Your Digital Vault";
// with tooltip: "A secure wallet that stores your health data"
```

---

### 2. **Unclear User Journey** 🔴 HIGH PRIORITY

#### Issues Identified:

- Landing page has no clear call-to-action hierarchy
- Three competing entry points: Dashboard, AI Companion, Wallet
- No indication of which feature to start with
- Beta notification appears AFTER clicking dashboard (should be upfront)

#### User Flow Confusion:

```
User lands → Sees rotating cards → Multiple buttons → Clicks random button → Confused
```

#### Expected Flow:

```
User lands → See onboarding → Connect wallet → Upload data → View insights
```

#### Recommendations:

1. Add persistent onboarding modal for first-time users
2. Clear step-by-step guidance (1 → 2 → 3)
3. Disable subsequent steps until previous ones complete
4. Show beta status immediately on landing

---

### 3. **Wallet Component Complexity** 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY

#### Current State (Connected):

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 👤 0x1234...5678                           │
│    ZKsync SSO                              │
│    [Profile On-Chain Badge]                │
│                                             │
│ [Create Session] or [End Session]          │
│                                             │
│ 🟢 Wallet connected ▼                      │
│    └─ Wallet / Dashboard / AI / Disconnect │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

#### Issues:

- Too many actions visible at once
- "Create Session" purpose unclear
- Badge terminology confusing
- Dropdown menu adds another layer

#### User Questions:

- 🤔 "Do I need to create a session before using the dashboard?"
- 🤔 "What happens if I don't create a session?"
- 🤔 "Why is my profile 'on-chain' and what does that mean?"

#### Simplified Alternative:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ✅ Connected                            │
│ 👤 Your Vault (0x1234...5678)          │
│                                         │
│ [Dashboard] [AI Companion] [Settings▼] │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 4. **Health Dashboard Entry Point** 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY

#### Current Flow:

1. Click "Dashboard"
2. Beta notification appears
3. Click "Got it"
4. Dashboard opens
5. See complex health data selector

#### Issues:

- `HealthDataSelector` component assumes user knowledge
- Multiple technical options (8 metrics, 4 time frames)
- No guidance on what to select
- Process button disabled without explanation initially

#### First-Time User Sees:

```
Select Time Frame: [7 Days] [30 Days] [90 Days] [1 Year]
Health Metrics: [Step Count] [Heart Rate] [HRV] [Respiratory Rate]
                [Exercise Time] [Resting HR] [Active Energy] [Sleep]
Upload Health Export: [Choose File]
[Process Selected Data - DISABLED]
```

#### User Questions:

- 🤔 "What's HRV?"
- 🤔 "Should I select all metrics or just some?"
- 🤔 "How do I export from Apple Health?"
- 🤔 "Why is the button disabled?"

#### Recommendations:

1. Add tooltip/help text for each metric
2. "Select All" / "Deselect All" buttons
3. Link to Apple Health export guide
4. Clear explanation why button is disabled

---

### 5. **AI Companion Complexity** 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY

#### Entry Requirements:

- Need health data uploaded first
- Need profile information (age, sex, height, weight)
- Profile can auto-populate from wallet OR manual entry

#### Confusion Points:

```typescript
// User sees different messages based on state:

// State 1: No health data
"No health data available yet. Process your data in the Health Dashboard..."

// State 2: Has data, no profile
"Please enter your profile information to generate a personalized health report."

// State 3: Wallet connected but loading
"Loading your profile from blockchain..."

// State 4: Everything ready
✅ Using profile data from your wallet
[Shows health report and chat]
```

#### Issues:

- Too many conditional states
- User doesn't know wallet has profile data
- Unclear relationship between wallet profile and AI companion
- "Generate Health Report" button appears but purpose unclear

---

### 6. **Mobile Responsiveness Gaps** 🟢 LOW PRIORITY

#### Issues Identified:

- Main page tagline hidden on mobile (`hidden sm:inline-block`)
- Wallet button complex UI on mobile (stacked buttons)
- Modal components generally good but some text truncation
- Progress indicators small on mobile

#### Mobile Experience Gaps:

```css
/* Main page header - tagline disappears */
<span className="text-2xl ... hidden sm:inline-block">
  - "Driven by Data, Guided by Nature"
</span>
```
